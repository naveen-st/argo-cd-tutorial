or Visit for https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/ 


## Running 
Make sure docker is running before running following command.

For single node cluster :
```
minikube start 
```
For multinode node cluster :
```
minikube start --nodes 3 -p multinode-demo
```

Test if installation is working fine.

### Troubleshoot

IF_VBOX_NOT_VISIBLE error

```
‚ùå  Exiting due to IF_VBOX_NOT_VISIBLE: Failed to start host: driver start: Error setting up host only network on machine start: The host-only adapter we just created is not visible. This is a well known VirtualBox bug. You might want to uninstall it and reinstall at least version 5.0.12 that is is supposed to fix this issue
```

- Check if docker is up and running 
- Try recreating the minikube cluster :
```
minikube delete && minikube start
```
